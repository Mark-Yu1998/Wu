        <h1>Wu Zetian</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/A_Tang_Dynasty_Empress_Wu_Zetian.JPG/220px-A_Tang_Dynasty_Empress_Wu_Zetian.JPG"></img>
        <p>Empress Wu Zetian (also known as Empress Consort Wu, Wu Hou, Wu Mei Niang, Mei-Niang, and Wu Zhao, 624-705 CE, r. 690-704 CE) was the only female emperor in the history of China. She reigned during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) and was one of
            the most effective and controversial monarchs in China's history. She began her life at court as a concubine of the emperor Taizong. After his death, she married his son, Gaozong (r. 649-683 CE) and became empress consort but actually was
            the power behind the emperor.</p>
        <p>When Gaozong died in 683 CE, Wu took control of the government as empress dowager, placing two of her sons on the throne and removing them almost as quickly. She was the power behind the throne from Gaozong's death in 683 CE until she proclaimed
            herself openly in 690 CE and ruled as emperor of China until a year before her death in 705 CE, at the age of 81.</p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Wu Zetian was born in Wenshi County, Shanxi Province, in 624 CE to a wealthy family. She was the daughter of Wu Shihuo, a chancellor of the Tang Dynasty. Unlike most young girls in China at this time, Wu was encouraged by her father to read and
            write and develop the intellectual skills which were traditionally reserved for males. Wu also learned to play music, write poetry, and speak well in public.</p>
        <p>She was very beautiful and was selected by emperor Taizong as one of his concubines when she was 14 years old. It was Taizong who called her 'Mei-Niang' meaning 'beautiful girl' (one of the names commonly, and wrongly, attributed to her as her
            birth name). Although the function of the concubine in China is almost always associated with sex, a woman in this position could have a number of non-sexual responsibilities, from daily tasks like taking care of the laundry to more specialized
            skills like conversation, poetry reading, and playing music.</p>
        <p>Wu began her life at court taking care of the royal laundry but one day dared to speak to the emperor when they were alone and talked about Chinese history. Taizong was surprised that his latest concubine could read and write and became fascinated
            by her beauty and wit in conversation. Taizong was so impressed at her intellectual abilities, he took her out of the laundry and made her his secretary. In her new position, she was constantly involved in affairs of state at the highest level
            and must have performed her duties well because she became a favorite of Taizong.</p>
        <p>She attracted the attention of many of the young men at court and one of these was the Prince Li Zhi, son of Taizong, who would become the next emperor, Gaozong. Wu began an affair with Li Zhi, who was married at the time, while still attached
            to Taizong as concubine. Li Zhi was deeply in love with Wu but could not do anything about it because she belonged to his father and, besides, he was already married.</p>
        <p>When Taizong died, Wu and his other concubines had their heads shaved and were sent to Ganye Temple to begin their lives as nuns. This was a common practice after the death of the emperor. The emperor's concubines could not be passed on to be
            used by others but were forced to end their time at court and start a new life of chastity in a religious order. However, when Li Zhi became emperor and took the name Gaozong, one of the first things he did was send for Wu and have her brought
            back to court as the first of his concubines, even though he had others and also a wife.</p>
        <h2>Rise To Power</h2>
        <p>Wu was given the privileged position of first concubine even though by&nbsp;law&nbsp;she should have been left in the temple as a nun. Gaozong's wife, Lady Wang, and his former first concubine, Xiao Shufei, were jealous of each other but even
            more envious of the attention Gaozong paid to Wu. According to Wu's own account, they conspired against her but, according to other historians, Wu started and finished the problems she had with them.</p>
        <p>Lady Wang had no children and Lady Xiao had a son and two daughters. In 652 CE, Wu gave birth to a son, Li Hong, and in 653 CE had another son, Li Xian. Neither of these boys was a threat to Lady Wang or Lady Xiao because Gaozong had already chosen
            a successor; his chancellor Liu Shi was Lady Wang's uncle, and Gaozong appointed Liu Shi's son, Li Zhong, as heir. Still, this did not mean the&nbsp;women&nbsp;were not jealous of the favor the emperor showed Wu now that she had given birth
            to two sons in a row.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 654 CE, Wu had a daughter who died soon after birth. The baby was strangled in her crib and Wu claimed that Lady Wang had killed her because she was jealous. Wang was the last person seen in the room and had no alibi. Wu also accused Lady Wang
            and her mother of practicing witchcraft and implicated Lady Xiao; Lady Wang was found guilty of all the charges and so were the others. Gaozong divorced his wife, barred her mother from the&nbsp;palace, and exiled Lady Xiao. Lady Wang's uncle,
            the chancellor Liu Shi, was removed from his post which meant his son was cut off as Gaozong's heir. Wu was now raised to the position of first wife of Gaozong and empress of China. She was also assured that her sons would rule the country
            after the death of her husband.</p>

    <div id="Why" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Why Wu Zetian?</h1>
        <p>She is the one and only female emperor in Chinese history, she is a woman who been through a lot to achieve the throne. Such as she lost her sons, her friends, and her husbands, yes, officially two of them.&nbsp;It is remarkable that she started
            as a candidate concubine of the emperor Li Shimin and ended up becoming the one and only female emperor in Chinese. In ancient China, women had very low social status, they were not allowed to go to school, and they could not leave their house
            until the day of their wedding. All they could learn were skills to help their future husband and children. Therefore, during that time, it was hard for a woman to have achievement in anything, especially in politics. However, she managed
            to make everyone trust her and work for her without a doubt. In addition, during her time as an empress, she did a great job, just as good as all other emperors, even better. She started her own dynasty Wu Zhou, and her dynasty also ended
            with her, she understood her dynasty was fully built on top of the Tang Dynasty, therefore, she gave the country back to the Li's family. She set a role model to all other women out there, during her time, the social status of women was raised
            significantly, such as women were allowed to go to school with men and work for the government.&nbsp;</p>

    <div id="Accomplishment" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In spite of her ruthless rise to power, Wu Zetian proved to be a very competent monarch and throughout her reign the legacy of prosperity was bequeathed.</li>
            <li>Wu Zetian was eager to draw into her government all manner of talented people. She even encouraged people to volunteer their services should they consider themselves competent. The imperial examination system was further revised in order that
                no man of ability should be excluded due to his lowly birth. She also initiated the practice of personally interviewing candidates. In this way, many political talents were found and employed in the government. Such people included the
                famous prime minister, Di Renjie, Zhang Jianzhi, etc.</li>
            <li>Wu Zetian attached great importance to the development of agriculture. She ordered the construction of irrigation schemes, and commissioned the compilation of farming textbooks. Local officials were evaluated by the task of cultivating land.
                As an incentive for increased production, taxes were reduced and corvee upon the peasant population was eased. By allowing peasant farmers to retain more of their produce, they were able to improve their lot and in general the population
                benefited from quite considerable prosperity.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Though Wu was a competent feudal monarch in terms of achievement she made, she was extremely ruthless murdering her relatives who tried to take advantage of her position. Those who opposed her in any way were quickly removed from office, exiled
            or forced to commit suicide including those founding fathers of the dynasty Zhangsun Wuji, Zhu Suiliang, Yu Zhining and Cheng Wuting and many others. Members of the Li royal family and their relatives were likewise eliminated. In addition,
            Wu favored Buddhism and ordered the construction of many Buddhist temples and sculptures nationwide, which added great pressure to the common people.</p>

    <div id="Wu and Women" class="tabcontent">
        <h1>Wu and Women</h1>
        <p>Even though according to the Confucian beliefs having a woman rule would be as unnatural as having a "hen crow like a rooster at daybreak," during the most glorious years of the Tang dynasty a woman did rule, and ruled successfully. She was Wu
            Zetian, the only female in Chinese history to rule as emperor. To some she was an autocrat, ruthless in her desire to gain and keep power. To others she, as a woman doing a "man's job," merely did what she had to do, and acted no differently
            than most male emperors of her day. They also note that she managed to effectively rule China during one of its more peaceful and culturally diverse periods.</p>
        <p>The Tang dynasty (618-906 AD) was a time of relative freedom for women. They did not bind their feet nor lead submissive lives. It was a time in which a number of exceptional women contributed in the areas of culture and politics. So it is no
            surprise that Wu, born into a rich and noble family, was taught to play music, write, and read the Chinese classics. By thirteen years of age she was known for her wit, intelligence, and beauty, and was recruited to the court of Emperor Tai
            Tsung. She soon became his favorite concubine. But she also had eyes for his son, Kao Tsung.</p>
        <p>When the emperor died and Kao Tsung took over, Wu was now twenty seven years old. In time she became a favorite concubine of the new emperor, giving birth to the sons he wanted. As mother of the future emperor of China, she grew in power. She
            managed to eliminate Kao Tsung's wife, Empress Wang, by accusing her of killing Wu's newborn daughter. Kao Tsung believed Wu, and replaced Empress Wang to marry the up and coming Wu Zetian.</p>
        <p>Within five years of their marriage, Emperor Kao Tsung suffered a crippling stroke. The Empress Wu took over the administrative duties of the court, a position equal to the emperor. She created a secret police force to spy on her opposition, and
            cruelly jailed or killed anyone who stood in her way, including the unfortunate Empress Wang. With the death of Emperor Kao Tsung, Wu managed to outflank her eldest sons and moved her youngest, and much weaker son, into power. She in effect
            ruled, telling him what to do.</p>
        <p>In order to challenge Confucian beliefs against rule by women, Wu began a campaign to elevate the position of women. She had scholars write biographies of famous women, and raised the position of her mother's clan by giving her relatives high
            political posts. She moved her court away from the seat of traditional male power and tried to establish a new dynasty. She said that the ideal ruler was one who ruled like a mother does over her children.</p>
        <p>In 690, Wu's youngest son removed himself from office, and Wu Zetian was declared emperor of China. In spite of her ruthless climb to power, her rule proved to be benign. She found the best people she could to run the government, and treated those
            she trusted fairly. She reduced the army's size and stopped the influence of aristocratic military men on government by replacing them with scholars. Everyone had to compete for government positions by taking exams, thus setting the practice
            of government run by scholars. Wu also was fair to peasants, lowering oppressive taxes, raising agricultural production, and strengthening public works.</p>
        <p>During her reign, Empress Wu placed Buddhism over Daoism as the favored state religion. She invited the most gifted scholars to China and built Buddhist temples and cave sculptures. Chinese Buddhism achieved its highest development under the reign
            of Wu Zetian.</p>
        <p>As she grew older, Empress Wu lessened the power of her secret police. But she become increasingly superstitious and fearful. Sorcerers and corrupt court favorites flattered her. Finally, in 705, she was pressured to give up the throne in favor
            of her third son, who was waiting all these years in the wings. Wu Zetian died peacefully at age eighty the same year.</p>
